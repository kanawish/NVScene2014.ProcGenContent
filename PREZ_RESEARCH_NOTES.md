# Presentation Research Notes

## Presentation Goals

We'll explore a gammut of procedural content generation techniques, and see how to use GPGPU techniques to turbocharge their performance.

	* High level concepts Ontogenetic and Teleological.
		* Perlin and Simplex noise.
		* Fractals, L-Systems
		* Cell Automata, Genetic algorithms
- Approach: a Small Mobile GPGPU Prototyping Framework

### Framework: Technology

[OpenGL ES 2.0](http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/#specs2) includes OpenGL **ES** Shading Language 1.0.17, [not to be confused](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8872105/what-versions-of-glsl-can-i-use-in-opengl-es-2-0) with it's non-ES counterpart, OpenGL Shading Language 1.10.  

[OpenGL ES 3.0](http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/#specs3) includes OpenGL ES Shading Language 3.00.4.

[OpenGL ES 3.1](http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/#specs31) upgrades OpenGL ES Shading Language to version 3.10. More relevant to today's talk, a great deal of the new feature set relates to general computing tasks.

The [Tegra 4](http://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/116757/Tegra_4_GPU_Whitepaper_FINALv2.pdf) does not support OpenGL ES 3.0, since it is missing a few features. (FP32 pixel shaders, EAC/ETC2 texture compression format, etc.) 

The [Tegra K1](http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/tegra_white_papers/Tegra_K1_whitepaper_v1.0.pdf) will reportedly support both OpenGL ES 3.0 and the full OpenGL 4.4 feature set, CUDA 6.0, as well as Tessellation and Compute shaders. 

*Note: This is interesting. How will this be made available to Android developpers? Special libraries and drivers seem to be in order. Big problem then becomes writing very NVidia specific code, developpers for now would have little incentive to do this for the large scale public. Might be interest for application specific, custom-made business projects? A K1 Ouya could be intringing...*

One focus of this talk is on General-purpose computing on GPU, a.k.a. [GPGPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPGPU). As per Wikipedia: *"OpenCL is the currently dominant open general-purpose GPU computing language. The dominant proprietary framework is Nvidia's CUDA."* 

Sadly, neither of these are standardly available to the Android developper. There are technical reasons and compatibility reasons [behind this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14385843/why-did-google-choose-renderscript-instead-of-opencl), perhaps some historical ones as well.

All in all, we do have two frameworks to our disposal. OpenGL ES Shading Language and RenderScript. Of the two, GLSL will result in code that will be more easily re-usable on other platforms. Renderscript, being specifically designed for GPGPU has interesting features that could make our job easier, but will result in less portable code in some ways. 

If you're aiming to do cross-platform projects (iOS/Android), you might be better served by the GLSL approach. If you're hoping to support a significant portion of the Android landscape (4000+ types of devices configurations at time of writing), you should probably give consideration to Renderscript.

[Renderscript](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/renderscript/compute.html) is now very much dedicated to computing tasks on large buffers of data, and should bring speed improvements on a wide variety of Android hardware. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renderscript) has a streamlined history.
